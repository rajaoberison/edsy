To install R on your computer, please visit this link: https://www.r-project.org/ You should also install RStudio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ We will use the packages in the tidyverse library: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) We will use a sample datasets from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. The advantage of these data is that they were collected and processed by our colleagues. So we have a good documentation on the sampling methods and the data processing workflow applied to eah of the datasets. "],
["reading.html", "Section 1 Reading 1.1 CSV 1.2 Excel 1.3 Google Spreadsheets 1.4 SPSS", " Section 1 Reading In this section, we learn how to read data from different file format. 1.1 CSV Reading csv with column headers and separated by ,. These parameters are also the default values for the read.csv function. data &lt;- read.csv(file = &#39;/path/to/csv&#39;, header = TRUE, sep = &#39;,&#39;) # Example data &lt;- read.csv(file = &#39;data/hurricane.csv&#39;, header = TRUE) 1.2 Excel The main advantage of Excel files is that they can store multiple tables. But reading these tables at once is different from a CSV. For this example, we’re going to use the readxl package from the tidyverse collection. Please visit this [website] (https://www.tidyverse.org/) to learn more about tidyverse. To read an excel file, you can use the read_excel function and specify at least the path/to/the/file and sheet you want to open. If you don’t specify the sheet, read_excel will automatically open the first table in the spreadsheet. In the ‘eds.excel.sample.xlsx’ file, there are 2 tables: heatwave and hurricane. Here’s how we load both tables into R: library(readxl) heatwave &lt;- read_excel(path=&#39;data/excel-sample.xlsx&#39;, sheet = &#39;heatwave&#39;) hurricane &lt;- read_excel(path=&#39;data/excel-sample.xlsx&#39;, sheet = &#39;hurricane&#39;) Once the tables are stored into individual R variable, you can perform exploration and analysis with them. 1.3 Google Spreadsheets If the data is stored in a Google spreadsheet, we can read it using the googledrive and googlesheet4 packages. We use the googledrive package to log into our Google Drive account and googlesheets4 to read the speadsheets in our drive. In the example below, I used a spreadsheet named eds.sample.googlesheets which contains the same tables in the previous Excel example (heatwave and hurricane). You can clone the spreadsheet via this [link] (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uIsgrcsevbm9voZU-rzqhTg2LE5SgEPlGabSXKTcQtc if you’d like to repeat the steps below using your Google account. Then authenticate to your drive using drive_auth(). When prompted: log in, authorized googledrive, and use the authorization code if provided. You only need to run drive_auth() once. library(googledrive) # To authenticate and authorize googledrive package drive_auth() The following scripts show how to explore a Google Drive folder. Though this is not recommended as you might encounter performance issues. # NOT recommended # Then, to view the list of files in a folder drive_ls(&quot;EDS&quot;) # where &quot;EDS&quot; is the folder name # To also get the files within the subfolders drive_ls(&quot;EDS&quot;, recursive = TRUE) # To view the list of spreadsheets within a folder drive_ls(&quot;EDS&quot;, type=&quot;spreadsheet&quot;) Also, because of Google authentification system, you may run into an error like below when running the previous code (using drive_ls()). Which is why it’s not recommended. #&gt; Error in add_id_path(nodes, root_id = root_id, leaf = leaf) : !anyDuplicated(nodes$id) is not TRUE To avoid this, you can use the folder url instead of the folder name. The folder url can be obtained by right-clicking on the folder and click Get shareable link. Then run the following code: # If using folder name doesn&#39;t work folder_url = &#39;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e0uJ9dwFcL34JA61F0tGSoaiMZ_xio_4&#39; drive_ls(folder_url, type=&quot;spreadsheet&quot;) Then you can load the spreadsheet by using its id eds.sample.spreadsheet &lt;- drive_get(id = &#39;1uIsgrcsevbm9voZU-rzqhTg2LE5SgEPlGabSXKTcQtc&#39;) It also possible to read the spreadsheet right way by using its link/path (without using drive_ls()). I recommend using this to read any Google Drive files. eds.sample.spreadsheet &lt;- drive_get(path = &#39;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uIsgrcsevbm9voZU-rzqhTg2LE5SgEPlGabSXKTcQtc&#39;) Once the spreadsheet is loaded, we run a similar code used for the Excel files to read tables within the spreadsheet. But for Google Sheets, function is called read_sheet library(googlesheets4) # Authorizing the googlesheets4 package sheets_auth(token=drive_token()) # Reading the tables heatwave &lt;- read_sheet(eds.sample.spreadsheet, sheet = &#39;heatwave&#39;) hurricane &lt;- read_sheet(eds.sample.spreadsheet, sheet = &#39;hurricane&#39;) 1.4 SPSS library(haven) data &lt;- read_sav(&quot;data/spss-sample.sav&quot;) By default, the read_sav() will read the factor levels of non-numeric and non-character variables. If, instead, we want the labels, we can run the following code: library(magrittr) library(dplyr) # Applying haven::as_factor() to labelled columns Here, we already know that # variables Zone, Q4 and Q50 are not factor variables. data %&gt;% mutate_at(vars(-Zone, -Q4, -Q50), as_factor) ## # A tibble: 1,130 x 9 ## Zone Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q10 Q50 Q51 Q59 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 A 2 3 0 Moderately Pr… No 1928 Male $70,000-$99… ## 2 A 1 4 0 Moderately Pr… No 1962 Male &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 A 3 4 0 Moderately Pr… No 1931 Fema… Over $200,0… ## 4 A 3 6 1 Fully Prepared No 1950 Male $100,000-$1… ## 5 A 2 Not Worried … 0 Very Prepared No 1948 Male $100,000-$1… ## 6 A 5 4 0 Very Prepared No 1938 Fema… &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 A 3 6 1 Moderately Pr… No 1977 Fema… &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 A 5 4 0 Moderately Pr… No 1964 Fema… &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 A 1 3 0 Moderately Pr… No 1976 Male $40,000-$69… ## 10 A 2 6 0 Very Prepared No 1964 Fema… Over $200,0… ## # … with 1,120 more rows Because variables can be labelled in SPSS, we can use them as well to find out what each column represents. # To get the labels of the variables / columns as.vector(unlist(lapply(data, function(x) attributes(x)$label))) ## [1] &quot;Q4.

["extraction.html", "Section 2 Extraction 2.1 Web Scraping", " Section 2 Extraction 2.1 Web Scraping Web scraping is the process of fetching and extracting information / data from a webpage. It is very useful if you want to create a dynamic database that updates based on the content of a specific website. To scrap a webpage, we first need to know how to get to the webpage, a url that you can use to directly access the content. For example, to obtain the Google search results for “data science”, you can simply copy and paste this url to your browser: https://www.google.com/search?q=data+science, without having to type “data science” on a Google search web page. Some websites like Twitter or Facebook will require to you to use an API and authenticate in order to access some of their data. For this example, we’re going to use The Weather Channel website which do not require autentification. We’ll to extract the 10-day forecast for a specific location and store the data in a dataframe. After inspecting the website and it’s url, I have noticed that you can view the weather data by zip code using this url pattern: https://weather.com/weather/ + forecast type + /l/ + zip_code + :4:US For example, if we want to view the 10-day forecast for New Haven, we can go to: https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/06511:4:US. And for today’s forecast: https://weather.com/weather/today/l/06511:4:US Once we have the webpage url, we can read it into R and extract the data using rvest from the tidyverse collection. The New Haven 10-day forecast webpage looks like this: weatherpage Basically, what we want is the table that has the weather information. In order to extract the values that we want, we have to know where in the source code they are located. For example, in the “DAY” column, we want to extract the exact date instead of the days of the week. And we can do that by: inspecting the tag or class of exact date from the website. Move the cursor to the exact date, right-click, then choose Inspect then, a window will open, which will point directly to the location of the exact date in the source code. Take notes of the css (tag or class name), and use it to get the exact date value using the html_nodes() function. weatherpage Here is how we extract the dates: library(rvest) ## Loading required package: xml2 # Get the webpage url url = &#39;https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/06511:4:US&#39; # Load the webpage using the url webpage &lt;- read_html(url) # Getting the exact date # Filtering the relevant css / location date_locations &lt;- html_nodes(webpage, &quot;span.day-detail.clearfix&quot;) # Extracting the exact value raw_date &lt;- html_text(date_locations) raw_date ## character(0) # Because the value are formatted like &quot;NOV 21&quot; we have to convert to a date format exact_date &lt;- as.Date(raw_date, format=&quot;%b %d&quot;) # b = month, d = day exact_date ## Date of length 0 And here is the full code that extract the complete table: library(rvest) # Get the webpage url url = &#39;https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/06511:4:US&#39; # Load the webpage using the url webpage &lt;- read_html(url) # Getting the exact date # Filtering the relevant css / location date_locations &lt;- html_nodes(webpage, &quot;span.day-detail.clearfix&quot;) # Extracting the exact value raw_date &lt;- html_text(date_locations) # Because the value are formatted like &quot;Nov 21&quot; we have to convert to a date format exact_date &lt;- as.Date(raw_date, format=&quot;%b %d&quot;) # b = month, d = day # Getting the weather description desc_loc &lt;- html_nodes(webpage, &quot;td.description&quot;) desc &lt;- html_text(desc_loc) # Getting the temperature temp_loc &lt;- html_nodes(webpage, &quot;td.temp&quot;) temp &lt;- html_text(temp_loc) # High and Low temperature values high_temp &lt;- rep(NA, length(temp)) low_temp &lt;- rep(NA, length(temp)) for (i in 1:length(temp)){ all &lt;- unlist(strsplit(temp[i], &quot;°&quot;)) if (length(all) &gt; 1){ high_temp[i] &lt;- all[1] low_temp[i] &lt;- all[2] } else { low_temp[i] &lt;- 38 } } # Getting the precipitation precip_loc &lt;- html_nodes(webpage, &quot;td.precip&quot;) precip &lt;- as.numeric(sub(&quot;%&quot;, &quot;&quot;, html_text(precip_loc))) / 100 # Getting the wind wind_loc &lt;- html_nodes(webpage, &quot;td.wind&quot;) wind &lt;- html_text(wind_loc) # Wind direction and speed wind_dir &lt;- rep(NA, length(wind)) wind_speed &lt;- rep(NA, length(wind)) for (i in 1:length(wind)){ all &lt;- unlist(strsplit(wind[i], &quot; &quot;)) wind_dir[i] &lt;- all[1] wind_speed[i] &lt;- all[2] } # Getting the humidity humidity_loc &lt;- html_nodes(webpage, &quot;td.humidity&quot;) humidity &lt;- as.numeric(sub(&quot;%&quot;, &quot;&quot;, html_text(humidity_loc))) / 100 # Save the data in tibble library(tibble) new_haven_forecast &lt;- tibble(&#39;day&#39; = exact_date, &#39;description&#39; = desc, &#39;high_temp&#39; = high_temp, &#39;low_temp&#39; = low_temp, &#39;precip&#39; = precip, &#39;wind_dir&#39; = wind_dir, &#39;wind_speed&#39; = wind_speed, &#39;himidity&#39; = humidity) new_haven_forecast ## # A tibble: 0 x 8 ## # … with 8 variables: day &lt;date&gt;, description &lt;chr&gt;, high_temp &lt;lgl&gt;, ## # low_temp &lt;dbl&gt;, precip &lt;dbl&gt;, wind_dir &lt;chr&gt;, wind_speed &lt;chr&gt;, ## # himidity &lt;dbl&gt; "],
["structuring.html", "Section 3 Structuring 3.1 Inspecting the data 3.2 Data types 3.3 Subsetting and Filtering 3.4 Changing cell values 3.5 Pivoting the dataset", " Section 3 Structuring Data structuring is the process of correcting or removing inaccurate records of a “raw data” so that, after the treatment, the transformed data will be easy to analyze and/or consistent with an existing dataset. More explicitly, the variable names, types, and values will be consistent and uniform. The focus here is on the ‘appearance’ of the data. 3.1 Inspecting the data In order to structure a dataset, first, we need to be able to detect the anomalies within the data. Types of anomalies include the values that are stored in the wrong format (ex: a number stored as a string), the values that fall outside of the expected range (ex: outliers), values with inconsistent patterns (ex: dates stored as mm/dd/year vs dd/mm/year), trailing spaces in strings (ex: “data” vs “data”), etc. One method of detecting these anomalies is the summary statistics of the variables, which can be obtained by using summary(). Here is an example using the hurricane data: # Structure of the data str(data[,1:3]) ## tibble [1,130 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ Zone: chr [1:1130] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;format.spss&quot;)= chr &quot;A9&quot; ## ..- attr(*, &quot;display_width&quot;)= int 1 ## $ Q4 : num [1:1130] 2 1 3 3 2 5 3 5 1 2 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;label&quot;)= chr &quot;Q4.

This is very common for numerically coded variables or ones that has levels. For example, if we read in the same SPSS data from the Reading data section, we get the coded values instead of the labels. ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## Zone Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q10 Q50 Q51 Q59 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; &lt;dbl+l&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl+l&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; ## 1 A 2 3 0 3 [Moderate… 2 [No] 1928 1 [Mal… 4 [$70,000… ## 2 A 1 4 0 3 [Moderate… 2 [No] 1962 1 [Mal… NA ## 3 A 3 4 0 3 [Moderate… 2 [No] 1931 2 [Fem… 6 [Over $2… ## 4 A 3 6 1 1 [Fully Pr… 2 [No] 1950 1 [Mal… 5 [$100,00… ## 5 A 2 1 [Not Worr… 0 2 [Very Pre… 2 [No] 1948 1 [Mal… 5 [$100,00… ## 6 A 5 4 0 2 [Very Pre… 2 [No] 1938 2 [Fem… NA So if we run summary(data) right away then we’ll get this unintended result: ## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(dots[[i]]): NAs introduced by coercion ## Zone Q4 Q5 Q6 ## Min. : NA Min. : 0.000 Min. :1.000 Min. :0.0000 ## 1st Qu.: NA 1st Qu.: 2.000 1st Qu.:1.000 1st Qu.:0.0000 ## Median : NA Median : 2.000 Median :2.000 Median :0.0000 ## Mean :NaN Mean : 2.537 Mean :1.617 Mean :0.4191 ## 3rd Qu.: NA 3rd Qu.: 3.000 3rd Qu.:2.000 3rd Qu.:1.0000 ## Max. : NA Max. :20.000 Max. :2.000 Max. :4.0000 ## NA&#39;s :1130 NA&#39;s :134 NA&#39;s :968 NA&#39;s :116 ## Q7 Q10 Q50 Q51 Q59 ## Min. :1.000 Min. :1.000 Min. : 19 Min. :1.00 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.:2.000 1st Qu.:2.000 1st Qu.:1944 1st Qu.:1.00 1st Qu.:3.000 ## Median :3.000 Median :2.000 Median :1955 Median :2.00 Median :4.000 ## Mean :2.674 Mean :1.796 Mean :1944 Mean :1.55 Mean :3.715 ## 3rd Qu.:3.000 3rd Qu.:2.000 3rd Qu.:1966 3rd Qu.:2.00 3rd Qu.:5.000 ## Max. :5.000 Max. :2.000 Max. :1992 Max. :2.00 Max. :6.000 ## NA&#39;s :114 NA&#39;s :123 NA&#39;s :47 NA&#39;s :38 NA&#39;s :112 Q4 and Q50 are the only variables that are supposed to be numeric.

But this is basically related to the survey method which would later require that some weighting of the variables would be applied. Q4: Number of storms experienced: where the mean value is 2.5 but some response have the value of 20. Q50: Birth year: where some respondent answered 19 which is incorrect. Also this column is probably better if it’s in age instead of birth year. We can also notice some missing values. 3.3 Subsetting and Filtering We can remove incorrect or missing row values by using dplyr::filter: # Removing rows where birth year is irrelevant # Here we decided that all birth year must be greater 1900 updated_data &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(Q50 &gt; 1900) # Now if we re-run its summary summary(updated_data$Q50) ## Min. 1st Qu.

We will apply this to Q5 as we have noticed in the previous section that not all of its values were labelled from SPSS. Here is its summary: ## Not Worried At All 2 3 4 ## 58 101 164 197 ## 5 6 Extremely Worried NA&#39;s ## 232 123 97 104 Looking back at the questionnare, here is how it was phrased: Because the survey itself doesn’t have labels, the recoding will be up to the user. Here we chose to remove replace the extreme values with 1 and 7. As mentionned in the documentation: dplyr::recode() will preserve the existing order of levels while changing the values, and dplyr::recode_factor() will change the order of levels to match the order of replacements. # Recoding Q5 recoded.with.recode &lt;- recode(data$Q5, `Not Worried At All`=&quot;1&quot;, `Extremely Worried`=&quot;7&quot;) summary(recoded.with.recode) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NA&#39;s ## 58 101 164 197 232 123 97 104 recoded.with.recode_factor &lt;- recode_factor(data$Q5, `Not Worried At All`=&quot;1&quot;, `Extremely Worried`=&quot;7&quot;) summary(recoded.with.recode_factor) ## 1 7 2 3 4 5 6 NA&#39;s ## 58 97 101 164 197 232 123 104 We can also change cell values without external libraries like dplyr by running the following code: # Add column age where the values are 2020 - Q50 data$age &lt;- 2020 - data$Q50 # Replace Q5 with value &quot;Not Worried At All&quot; to &quot;1&quot; data$Q5[data$Q5 == &quot;Not Worried At All&quot;] &lt;- 1 ## Warning in `[&lt;-.factor`(`*tmp*`, data$Q5 == &quot;Not Worried At All&quot;, value = ## structure(c(3L, : invalid factor level, NA generated 3.5 Pivoting the dataset In some cases, we may want to split a column based on values, or merge multiple columns into fewer columns. These process can be done using tidyr package. For example, to convert the dataframe into long-format with only Zone, question, and value as columns: library(tidyr) # We have to pivot by variable type # Pivot longer for factor variables pivoted.longer &lt;- data %&gt;% select_if(is.factor) %&gt;% pivot_longer(-Zone, names_to = &quot;question&quot;, values_to = &quot;value&quot;) pivoted.longer ## # A tibble: 5,380 x 3 ## Zone question value ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 A Q5 3 ## 2 A Q7 Moderately Prepared ## 3 A Q10 No ## 4 A Q51 Male ## 5 A Q59 $70,000-$99,999 ## 6 A Q5 4 ## 7 A Q7 Moderately Prepared ## 8 A Q10 No ## 9 A Q51 Male ## 10 A Q59 &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 5,370 more rows # Then we can reshape it back to the original pivoted.wider &lt;- pivoted.longer %&gt;% group_by(question) %&gt;% mutate(row = row_number()) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = question, values_from = value) %&gt;% select(-row) pivoted.wider ## # A tibble: 1,076 x 6 ## Zone Q5 Q7 Q10 Q51 Q59 ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 A 3 Moderately Prepared No Male $70,000-$99,999 ## 2 A 4 Moderately Prepared No Male &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 A 4 Moderately Prepared No Female Over $200,000 ## 4 A 6 Fully Prepared No Male $100,000-$199,999 ## 5 A &lt;NA&gt; Very Prepared No Male $100,000-$199,999 ## 6 A 4 Very Prepared No Female &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 A 6 Moderately Prepared No Female &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 A 4 Moderately Prepared No Female &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 A 3 Moderately Prepared No Male $40,000-$69,999 ## 10 A 6 Very Prepared No Female Over $200,000 ## # … with 1,066 more rows tidyr::spread() and tidyr::gather() are the outdated equivalent of tidyr::pivot_wider() and tidyr::pivot_longer().

["cleaning.html", "Section 4 Cleaning 4.1 Fixing skewed distribution 4.2 Treating outliers 4.3 Fixing missing values", " Section 4 Cleaning Data cleaning is the process of getting the data ready for statistical analysis. In contrast to “Structuring the data” the target anomalies in this case are the variable values such as missing values, outliers, distribution, etc. 4.1 Fixing skewed distribution A data is skewed when it’s distribution is not symetrical but rather distored on the left or right. Sometimes, to facilitate statistical analysis, we need to transform that skewed data so that it becomes normally distributed instead. # Example of skewed data {x &lt;- data$nstorm h &lt;- hist(x, breaks=20, col=&quot;grey&quot;) xfit &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length=40) yfit &lt;- dnorm(xfit, mean=mean(x), sd=sd(x)) yfit &lt;- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x) lines(xfit, yfit, col=&quot;red&quot;, lwd=2)} # Log-transformation {log.x &lt;- log(data$nstorm) h &lt;- hist(log.x, breaks = 10, col = &quot;grey&quot;)} While the previous log-transformation seem to have worked, it is not entirely correct because the variable nstorm has 0 values. In this case, one of the commonly used method is square root. # sqrt transformation {sqrt.x &lt;- sqrt(data$nstorm) h &lt;- hist(sqrt.x, breaks = 10, col = &quot;grey&quot;)} 4.2 Treating outliers Outliers are usually extreme values in the datasets. If not detected and handled appropriately, they can affect the accuracy of the predicitions and analysis. Treating outliers depends on a good knowledge of the data and it is up to the data analyst to decide on how to go about on fixing them. Selva Prabhakaran gave some ways of handling outliers that we’re going to show below. You can detect outliers using boxplot and they will show up as dots outside the whiskers: # For continuous variable outlier_values &lt;- unique(boxplot.stats(data$nstorm)$out) # outlier values. boxplot(data$nstorm, main=&quot;How many storm have you experienced?&quot;, boxwex=0.1) mtext(paste(&quot;Outliers: &quot;, paste(outlier_values, collapse=&quot;, &quot;)), cex=0.6) # For categorical variable boxplot(nstorm ~ worry, data=data, main=&quot;Number of storms experienced across levels of worry&quot;) Approaches for outlier treatment include imputation with mean, median, or mode. We can also cap the values, predict them, or delete the observations. We’ll talk more about that below. 4.3 Fixing missing values Ways of detectng missing values (NA) include the summary and anyNA(). anyNA(data$nstorm) ## [1] TRUE summary(data$nstorm) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s ## 0.000 2.000 2.000 2.599 3.000 20.000 50 The easiest way to handle them is by removing all of the corresponding observations using tidyr::drop_na(). Or, in some cases, removing the variable itself. tidyr::drop_na(data) ## # A tibble: 775 x 13 ## nstorm worry nevac prepared homeloc nyear gender income politics age zone ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2 3 0 3 2 86 1 4 3 86 A ## 2 3 6 1 1 1 52 1 5 3 64 A ## 3 2 1 0 2 3 15 1 5 3 66 A ## 4 1 3 0 3 3 4 1 3 1 38 A ## 5 2 6 0 2 2 17 2 6 2 50 A ## 6 3 5 0 2 3 70 1 4 4 71 A ## 7 2 7 0 2 1 24 2 5 2 60 A ## 8 2 5 0 2 2 18 2 5 2 55 A ## 9 1 3 1 3 2 2 1 6 4 51 A ## 10 2 3 1 2 1 64 2 5 3 64 A ## # … with 765 more rows, and 2 more variables: lat &lt;dbl&gt;, long &lt;dbl&gt; However, if dropping all of the rows with missing values affect the quality of the data, then another option is to replace the missing values with the mean/median/mode of the variable or predict using an appropriate algorithm. There are several packages out there that are solely dedicated to treating missing values including VIM and MICE. In this next example, we’ll try to predict the 15 missing values in the variable nstorm (number of storms the survey respondents have experienced) using the variables that has no missing values: zone, lat, and long. # Imputation using MICE library(mice) # Building the mice model mice_model &lt;- mice(select(data, zone, lat, long, nstorm), method=&quot;rf&quot;, printFlag=F) ## Warning: Number of logged events: 1 # Predicting the missing values # generate the completed data mice_prediction &lt;- complete(mice_model) # checking for NAs anyNA(mice_prediction) ## [1] FALSE Then we can visualize the data to see how well the imputation has performed.

For example, in this app, you can create different types of graph by selecting a site and other parameters. Basically, it’s web development using the power of R libraries. So, just like any web tools, an RshinyApp has components on the User and Server side. The visual appearance of the app can be modified in the user component. You can use it to change layout, font size, color, etc. Whereas on the server side, you can customize how your app responds to user inputs/interactions. A basic ShinyApp starter template looks like this: library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage() server &lt;- function(input, output){} shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server) If you run the script above, it will give you and empty page. Some content will show when you add some (text) elements with fluidPage. ui &lt;- fluidPage(&#39;Hello world&#39;) server &lt;- function(input, output){} shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server) 5.3.1 Input functions For richer content, the shiny package has built-in functions that will allow you create them. sliderInput for example adds a slider in your web app. ui &lt;- fluidPage( sliderInput(inputId=&#39;num&#39;, label=&#39;Choose a number&#39;, value=25, min=1, max=100) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){} shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server) sliderInput is part of a group of function called inputs. These functions allow an Rshiny developper like yourself to add html element that will serve as user input. Here are some input functions you can try: All input functions take as first 2 arguments: inputId and label. inputId is an ID that R will use create the input element in a webpage and to reference it later. label is just a text that the user will see, describing what the input element is for. The rest of the arguments are function-specific. 5.3.2 Output functions Output functions, on the other hand, allow you to add outputs of R into your web page. As you know, these outputs can be image, plot, table, text, etc. And there are specific output functions for each type of output. Rshiny output functions Output functions are called similarly to the input functions: Here is our app with an output function: ui &lt;- fluidPage( sliderInput(inputId=&#39;num&#39;, label=&#39;Choose a number&#39;, value=25, min=1, max=100), plotOutput(&#39;hist&#39;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){} shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server) Running the previous script won’t show any plot though. It just reserve a space in the webpage for plot with id: ‘hist’. To actually create the plot, you must use the server function. 5.3.3 Server function Server function creates the interactivity in your web application, i.e. this is where you set up how an output (ex: graph) chnages with the user input (ex: some number). However, there are 3 rules that has to be followed and it is summarized in this script: function(input, output){ #1 outputId is the outputId you defined with output function #2 to render on a webpage. To render a plot, use renderPlot() output$outputId &lt;- renderSomething({ #3 inputId is the inputId you defined with input function someFunction(input$inputId) }) } # Anything inside the curly braces is an R code. And it can be multiple lines of code. In summary, you must define output variable by the outputId and prefixing it with output$. You must call the R script that will produce the output with a render*({}) function. And you must call the user input with its inputId and prefixing it with input$. In our example script, we can render it as follow: ui &lt;- fluidPage( sliderInput(inputId=&#39;num&#39;, label=&#39;Choose a number&#39;, value=25, min=1, max=100), plotOutput(&#39;hist&#39;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$hist &lt;- renderPlot({ title &lt;- paste(input$num, &#39;random normal values&#39;) hist(rnorm(input$num), main=title, xlab=&#39;values&#39;) }) } shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server) To make much more advanced app, simply read the instructions on Rshiny website. 5.3.4 Sharing your app Now you can create your own Shiny app. But for now you can only run it in your computer and no one else has access to it. To make available to the public: Save the ui and server objects/scripts into a stand alone R script, name it app.R, and save it in a separate folder. You must name it app.R as that’s the file that the server will look for when you deploy your app. For this example, I’d save this as app.R ui &lt;- fluidPage( sliderInput(inputId=&#39;num&#39;, label=&#39;Choose a number&#39;, value=25, min=1, max=100), plotOutput(&#39;hist&#39;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$hist &lt;- renderPlot({ title &lt;- paste(input$num, &#39;random normal values&#39;) hist(rnorm(input$num), main=title, xlab=&#39;values&#39;) }) } Go to shinyapps.io and log in or sign for an account. Now simply run the app on your computer In the top right cover of R viewer window, there is a Publish button that you can use to publish your app. Simply follow the instructions. "],

We will give descriptives of the distribution of these two variables and then a simple extrapolation and compute total for the whole US christian population. Our variables of interest are: GWHap: On a scale from 1 to 7, how strongly do you believe that global warming is or is not happening? GWworry: How worried are you about global warming? 6.1.2.1 Step 1: Design weights In the paper, it is mentionned that participants were recruited via Prime Panels. And only those who previously identified as christians were selected. It should be good to assume that each participants had an equal probability of being sampled. Therefore, we can skip the Step 1 of the weighting. If we had to compute the design weight \\(d_i\\), it would be equal to the inverse of the probability of being sampled: \\(1/p_i\\). Per Josep Espaga Reig’s book: the design weights can be interepreted as “the number of units in our population that each unit in our sample represents. […] The sum of all design weights should be equal to the total number of units in our population”. 6.1.2.2 Step 2: Non-response weights The paper also doesn’t mention any information about non-respondent during the survey. So we can assume that there is no bias in the responses and we can skip Step 2. In short, the goal of Step 2 is to account for differences in propensity to respond among the participants. For example, participants from specific neighborhood, income level, etc may have lower response rates, and all the response we have are from a specific demographic groups, which would bias the analysis. 6.1.2.3 Step 3: Using auxillary data for weight calibration The goal here is to calibrate the survey data to the population in general. So we would need information on both the survey respondents and the population. In this case, we will use demographic variables (gender, education, and race). One of the most common method for calibration weighting is called: raking which we will use as an the example. We’ll use as auxiliary data the PEW Datasets which gives some statistics of the US christian population. We’ll scrape the data directly from their website so that we’ll have fewer data wrangling to do. # PEW data # getting only the christian respondent and their weights pew.data &lt;- read_sav(&#39;data/pew-data.sav&#39;) %&gt;% select(RELTRAD, agerec, SEX, racethn, WEIGHT) %&gt;% mutate(across(where(is.labelled), as_factor)) %&gt;% mutate(across(where(is.factor), as.character)) %&gt;% mutate( religion = RELTRAD %&gt;% recode( `Evangelical Protestant Tradition`=&#39;christian&#39;, `Mainline Protestant Tradition`=&#39;christian&#39;, `Historically Black Protestant Tradition`=&#39;christian&#39;, `Catholic`=&#39;christian&#39;, `Mormon`=&#39;christian&#39;, `Orthodox Christian`=&#39;christian&#39;, `Jehovah&#39;s Witness`=&#39;christian&#39;, `Other Christian`=&#39;christian&#39;, `Jewish`=&#39;other&#39;, `Muslim`=&#39;other&#39;, `Buddhist`=&#39;other&#39;, `Hindu`=&#39;other&#39;, `Other World Religions`=&#39;other&#39;, `Other Faiths`=&#39;other&#39;, `Unaffiliated (religious &quot;nones&quot;)`=&#39;other&#39;, `Don&#39;t know/refused - no information on religious identity`=&#39;other&#39;, ), pew.age = agerec %&gt;% recode( `Age 24 or younger`=&#39;18-29&#39;, `Age 25-29`=&#39;18-29&#39;, `30-34`=&#39;30-49&#39;, `35-39`=&#39;30-49&#39;, `40-44`=&#39;30-49&#39;, `45-49`=&#39;30-49&#39;, `50-54`=&#39;50-64&#39;, `55-59`=&#39;50-64&#39;, `60-64`=&#39;50-64&#39;, `65-69`=&#39;65+&#39;, `70-74`=&#39;65+&#39;, `75-79`=&#39;65+&#39;, `80-84`=&#39;65+&#39;, `85-89`=&#39;65+&#39;, `Age 90 or older`=&#39;65+&#39;, `Don&#39;t know/refused`=&#39;NA&#39;
